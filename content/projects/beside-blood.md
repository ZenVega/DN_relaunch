  title: Insights into your cycle
  subtitle: An object set breaking menstrual taboos and empowering self-exploration.
disclaimer: Beside Blood is a project that aims to empower people to explore the
  changes in their bodies during their menstrual cycle, while addressing the
  social taboo surrounding menstruation. The project includes objects and a
  booklet that cover different aspects of the cycle, such as changes in cervix,
  basal body temperature, cervical fluids, and menorrhea. The objects are
  designed to minimize barriers to self-examination and are aesthetically
  pleasing accessories that could be displayed in a bathroom. The current
  3D-printed prototypes could be produced using porcelain, which is
  hypoallergenic and easy to clean. In the seventies, feminists in the USA built
  the first women's health centers, where they discussed the cycle,
  contraception, and abortion, but also examined themselves. The exchange and
  sharing of knowledge helped them rebel against the social taboo and stand up
  for sexual self-determination, leading to a new position towards doctors and
  greater awareness of gynecological practices. Their work served as an
  inspiration for this project.
