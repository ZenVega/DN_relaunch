        Every year, around 100,000 people terminate a pregnancy involuntarily
        and another 100,000 receive the diagnosis of a disturbed early pregnancy
        (miscarriage). For those affected, it is still difficult to find
        medically correct and value-neutral information. Alli is therefore
        developing offers that can benefit both groups.\

        We are working on the Alli-Box and the Alli-App to support patients and doctors. The Alli-Box facilitates the delivery of necessary medication to patients by doctors, while the Alli-App guides patients through the entire process and provides them with daily information, action options, and answers to frequently asked questions. As a team, we bring together expertise in medicine, design, and programming and are working on prototypes that we are currently testing and developing.

      body: Alli's flagship product is the Alli-App, designed to guide patients
        through the entire medication abortion process. With daily updates on
        next steps, side effect management, and FAQs, the app provides patients
        with the support they need. Thanks to funding from the Prototype Fund
        with resources from the BMBF, the app is already in development.

      title: Box
      body: We're developing the Alli-Box to improve the situation for patients and
        support medical professionals. Currently, medication for medical
        pregnancy termination is typically handed out to patients in cut-out
        blisters with handwritten numbers, often lacking important additional
        information. This approach is not only undignified but can also lead to
        patients struggling to access medically accurate and value-neutral
        information about the medication online. This is where the Alli-Box
        comes in. We're creating a comprehensive packaging solution that
        provides patients with the information they need and supports medical
        professionals in their care. Our packaging solution will also be
        available as an empty box for medical professionals to dispense
        medication in a dignified and safe manner.
