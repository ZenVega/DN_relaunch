subtitle: More than just a newsletter
disclaimer: thus is my heart project - a newsletter that shares my passion for
  design with friends, family, and colleagues. It showcases that designing is
  about discovering new perspectives, exploring uncharted territories, and
  creating meaningful experiences. Each issue is curated with a specific theme
  and provides updates on my work, cool projects, and curated links related to
  the topic, with opportunities to apply included.  Check all previous issues
