  subtitle: A concept for STI testing on paper. Quick, easy, and discreet at home
    alone  or with others.
disclaimer: >-
  The spread of sexually transmitted diseases has increased in recent years,
  highlighting the need for timely detection to prevent potential consequences
  such as infertility. However, the stigma and inconvenience of traditional
  testing methods can discourage many people from getting tested.


  Beyond Pleasure offers a simple and discreet solution with paper testing that can be done in the privacy of one's home, alone or with a partner. This revolutionary concept aims to combat the shame and hassle associated with traditional testing methods. The test is easy to use, as paper pressed to varying degrees creates capillaries in the core of the test, allowing the test fluid to be drawn to the test solution and react. Once used, the test can be safely burned.

        Visually appealing, and user-friendly STD tests can motivate people to
        get tested more frequently, enabling them to quickly detect and treat
        transmissible diseases. Barriers such as scheduling


        appointments at counseling centers, sending tests for analysis, or seeking confirmation from a doctor can lead individuals to carry the disease for too long, potentially spreading it further.


        To break the stigma and reluctance associated with STD testing, it requires innovative design and positioning in easily accessible places like drugstores. By breaking taboos and making testing more


        approachable, it is possible to encourage more individuals to prioritize their sexual health and foster a proactive approach to preventing the spread of infections.

        The test consists of chromatography paper in multiple layers. The paper
        is highly absorbent. Water-permeable and impermeable areas are created
        through blind embossing and wax printing.


        By connecting the layers, narrow channels are formed, which absorb the sample - capillary action. This quickly transports the sample to the reaction zone. Along the way, the sample crosses the buffer solution, which ensures its neutralization.


        In some test procedures, two different buffers are required to react at different times. This is achieved by creating various channels of different lengths. Sampling windows and reaction windows are located on the front and back, shortening the path the sample needs to go.

      body: For some people, privacy can be of extrem importance, especially when it
        comes to sensitive matters like STD tests. Keeping such information
        discreet can be essential for maintaining confidentiality and simply
        having the freedom to handle one's health privately. Beyond Pleasure's
        STD tests can be easily burned, leaving no traces behind.
